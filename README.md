## Projects
### Water potability analysis using Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Ada Boost models.

My client had requested assistance in predicting the potability of water and provided me with a dataset that contained 2007 records and 10 features. This was a case of classification and was conducted in **Python** by preparing the models by splitting the data into a training and testing set, using the Isolation Forest technique to remove outliers, scaling the data to avoid weighted presence of any features, plotting the learning curves to understand the biases and variances, model analysis of Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and AdaBoost models against their recall, running the optimized Logistic regression and Naïve Bayes model, and finally creating the voting model using voting classifies, repeated k-fold, and cross-validation.
Based on my findings, I recommended the AdaBoost model based on the comparative results. It's important to note that the performance differences were relatively small, suggesting that all three models provide somewhat similar prediction capabilities on this dataset. AdaBoost model is known to be consistent, robust, and versatile and works well on various types of datasets  with fewer assumption requirements. Also, interpretations and explanations from this model are relatively easier.

Since none of the models performed particularly well, adding hyperparameter tuning and enhancing ensemble diversity would improve the model by improving its generalization capability.

### Possum regularization using optimized Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net models.

### Rasin categorization using Optimized Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistical Regression, and Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA)

I classified a categorization problem of segregating raisins using optimized Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA) using **Python**. Out of all, the Optimized QDA showed the best performance with an 89% accuracy, a higher precision of 96% for Besni in comparison to 84% for the Kecimen class. This is a measure of correctly predicting positive samples relative to the total samples predicted as positive.
The dataset had only 900 observations. Although difficult to monitor the collection of data, and expensive, a larger and normally distributed dataset would suffice the assumption for both LDA and QDA (better-performing models).

### House price prediction using multivariate regression modeling

My client was curious to know the housing price prediction in a neighborhood using a multiple regression model in **Python**. Unfortunately, the model was not feasible as the RMSE and MAE both were greater than 10% of the mean price i.e., 68,121.59. Regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge could possibly help improve the model's performance.
![Housing prices prediction using linear regression](/Housing prices - Linear regression.png)
Using feature engineering, selecting appropriate features or a combination of features could result in an improved model. For example, exploring a combination of the basement & garage together as a variable could possibly give us further insights. Additionally collecting more data: This dataset only compromises of 546 observations. A larger dataset would be helpful in training the model and would also provide us with a bigger test set, which in return would give us a more accurate representation of the underlying patterns in the data.
